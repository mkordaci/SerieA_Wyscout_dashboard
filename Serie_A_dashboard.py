                \n- Here, I hope to demonstrate my ability to use this event data to create visually appealing graphics that can be used to analyse individual player performance, team performance and provide data-driven metrics where appropriate.

                - This xG flow chart shows how the shooting opportunities created by each team varied over the course of the match.
                \n- Juventus were the team on the offensive for the majority of the match, due to the continuously bumpy xG line showing they created shooting opportunities (even if only small) fairly frequently.
                \n- Also clear to see Sampdoria were the defensive/counter-attacking team for large periods of the match due to long periods of a stagnant xG line. 
    - This shows that they were only creating shooting opportunities fairly infrequently, for example having 0 xG generated for the first 25 minutes of the match.
                \n- Can possibly infer from this chart a question over the fitness/concentration of the Sampdoria defence towards the end of the match. 
    - Between the 75th and 80th minutes of the match, Juventus were able to generate over 1 xG in this 5 minute period, which could be due to a lack of fitness or concentration in the later stages of the match. 
    - Alternatively, this could demonstrate the superior fitness of the Juventus attackers, or positive substitutions made to attack a tiring Sampdoria defence.
                \n- It is important to note however that a sample size of one match is not adequate to draw such large conclusions, we would need to see this pattern occurring over 10s of matches to be able to conclude any hard insights from this type of graphic.

                    These pass maps can be used to highlight passing patterns on a individual or team basis.
                    \nFurther developments upon this interactive passing page could be:
                    \n- Segment the pitch into channels or dangerous sectors, collating pass data to these areas of the pitch to draw insights regarding dangerous passes
                    \n- Create passing networks to understand passing patterns across the team between players
    - This can demonstrate relationships between players on the pitch and where these can be improved to implement coaching tactics more effectively
                    \n- Highlight progressive passes (based on varying defintions by data provider or "in-club" definition of progressive pass)
